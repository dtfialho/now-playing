# #nowPlaying

#### This is a simple test to evaluate my skills as a frontend developer

The #NowPlaying page is a simple one-page app where visitors can visualize the most recent videos being shared on Twitter by people nearby

The server choice is NodeJS because it's entirelly written with Javascript, what makes the frontend integration easier. Besides it can handle a lot of requests without using a lot of memory from the server because of it's event loop instead of opening a high amount of threads for every connection, and it has an easy integration with mongodb.

As for the frontend i used React with Redux, React is a famous framework maintained by Facebook, it is fast and it's lifecycle is better than other frameworks when it is about change detection, it changes only the elements that actually changed instead of "reloading" the entire state of the application and with Redux is easy to handle it's state.
